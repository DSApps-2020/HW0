1. Please open up a Github account. You *could* use this Github later in life for private projects, so:
	* do register with an email account you're comfortable with
	* do register with a "serious" user name, perhaps just your email handle which is easy to remember
	* do remember the password
2. Please fill up [this](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeEnqho4eU-YtkGTFTBDhxwMetrNNRZhh7gALH8dajSZKUIkA/closedform) survey. It is not anonymized. It is meant mainly for me to be able to connect your Github account, email and Uni. ID.
